# PRODIGY_DS_01
In this task we are creating a bar chart and histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical and continuous variable. In this task, we are using a sample dataset containing demographic information such as age and gender. The goal is to provide a clear visual representation of how the values of the chosen variable are distributed within the population. This can help in understanding the composition and identifying any trends or patterns.
